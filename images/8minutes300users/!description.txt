File naming:
	<framework>_<http_interface>_<db_interface>_<tool>_<measurements_nr>
example:
	Spring_blocking_blocking_jmc_1
options:
	<framework> - Spring / Micronaut / Quarkus
	<http_interface> - blocking / reactive
	<db_interface> - blocking / reactive / reference
	<tool> - taurus / jmc
	<measurements_nr> - 1 / 2

meaning:
	Taurus - automation framework for running load testing tools - in this case JMeter.
	JMC (JavaMissionControl) - tools suite for JVM. Here used for gathering data about application, and creating graphs.
	blocking - typical blocking interface. Single thread corresponds to single http request. In that case query to db is blocking.
	reactive - non-blocking interface. Few threads serve all requests. In all descriptions found online it is described as event loop.
	reference - no db request for http requests. In this case request returned predefined string
